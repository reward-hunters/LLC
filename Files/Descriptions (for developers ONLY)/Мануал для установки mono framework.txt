Well, I made a great research, and now can tell, that as I understand, all troubles in mono framework.
We have two different solutions for usual Mac and for Mac with El Capitan.
For both variants first you should do licensing and setup our program, as usual.
Next we should install mono framework.
For first variant use this manual:
1. Download Mono.framework  using this link:
 http://www.mono-project.com/download/
And button: " Download Mono MDK"
2. Setup this package
3. Reboot your mac
4. Open terminal and execute command (please be carefull. If it says that command not correct - recheck it please):

sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Commands/mono /usr/bin/mono

Type your admin password and press enter.

5. Reboot your mac - and all works!


For Mac with El Capitan follow this instructions:
1. Download Mono.framework for El Capitan using this link:
 http://www.mono-project.com/download/
And button: "Download Mono MDK (El Capitan Preview)"
2. Setup this package
3. Reboot your mac
4. Open terminal and try to execute this command (please be carefull. If it says that command not correct - recheck it please):

sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Commands/mono /usr/bin/

Type your admin password and press enter.

5. IF you got an exeption ("Operation not permitted") - trouble with El Capitan security.
You should disable it using this link:

6. After step 5 - again do step 4, reboot - and all works!
